# Advent of code 2024

Last year I started to do the challenge in Rust, which was not a good decision. As I didn't know anything about Rust, it was hard to embrace the challenge of a new language and the increasing complexity of the advent of code. This year I chose to go with the language I have more experience, so Javascript it is.

## Learned lessons

### Day 1

It wasn't hard. For the part 1, my first solution didn't consider that values could be negative when doing list2 - list1, so then I used the Math.abs(), which solved the problem. For the part 2, my solution worked in the first time, which makes me happy.
